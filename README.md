## Project Title
Udacity Bikeshare

### Description
This is the second project in Udacity nanodegree program for "Programming for data science"
The project is to use data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

## Files inside the repository
### Code
bikeshare.py

### Dataset
chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv
### README
README.md

## Requirements
Python 3.x and Pandas

## Questions explored
The script answers the following questions about the bike share data:
* What is the most popular month for start time?
* What is the most popular day of week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) for start time?
* What is the most popular hour of day for start time?
* What is the total trip duration and average trip duration?
* What is the most popular start station and most popular end station?
* What is the most popular trip?
* What are the counts of each user type?
* What are the counts of gender?
* What are the earliest (i.e. oldest person), most recent (i.e. youngest person), and most popular birth years?

## How to run the script
You can run the script using a Python integrated development environment (IDE) such as Spyder. To install Spyder, you will need to [download the Anaconda installer](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). This script is written in Python 3, so you will need the Python 3.x version of the installer. After downloading and installing Anaconda, you will find the Spyder IDE by opening Anaconda Navigator.


## Resources
To complete the project, I used my knowledge which I gained over the course of studying the Python Foundation Nanodegree Program on Udacity.
If I got stuck some place, the source(s) below helped me-
1. [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
2. [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/)
3. [Tutorials Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/)
4. [Pandas Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.17.0/)
5. I used [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) extensively for quickly running small snippets of code, and [Atom editor](https://atom.io/) for bigger pieces of code.
